Note for you guys: I changed Simple_window.cpp and .h to Menu_window.cpp and .h, although the code is mostly the same. I also put Isach's and Jack's code in image.cpp, but that part of the program isn't working yet for some reason. It does, hoever, compile fine. Just a bit buggy 

Once inside the same directory as aggiesnap.cpp, type the following command to run:

g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp *.h fltk/*.cpp -lfltk -lfltk_images
